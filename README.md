This project was to demostrate my ability to:

1) Work with ES6 Classes and begin to understand the basics of OOP(Object Oriented Programming).

2) Deploy a website using Webpack and have all pages be dynamically loaded utilizing Javascript instead of relying on html and css to run in the background.
